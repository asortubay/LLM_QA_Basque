# LLM QA on Basque Language

This project aims to explore and develop a question-answering system for the Basque language using a large language model (LLM). The notebook demonstrates how to apply state-of-the-art language models to build an effective QA system, specifically tailored for a less commonly studied language like Basque.

## Introduction

The Basque language is unique, with a limited number of resources compared to more widespread languages. This project provides a baseline for creating a question-answering system in Basque by leveraging existing LLMs, NLP techniques, and datasets to bridge the gap in linguistic technology for underrepresented languages.

## Features
- A notebook-based workflow to develop a QA system for the Basque language.
- Leverages pretrained large language models to answer questions in Basque.
- Step-by-step explanations to assist other researchers and developers interested in NLP for low-resource languages.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM_QA_Basque.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd LLM_QA_Basque
   ```
3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To use the notebook and experiment with the QA system:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LLM_QA_on_Basque.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run different sections of the code.

This notebook will guide you through the process of training, testing, and evaluating the QA model.
